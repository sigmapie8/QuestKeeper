# QuestKeeper
This REPO is for maintaining our tasks and keeping us focused. Anyone interested in doing it our way can collab.

Questkeeper is a goal tracker and group motivation initiative. The aim is to set a couple of goals for your week and the complete them.

You're supposed to commit a minimum of 10 hours each week to your goals (referred to as milestones).

Milestones have to be declared in the begining of the week and then progress has to be updated.

To join Questkeeper or to start your own instance of Questkeeper, please go through the documentation in Framework. For a quick walkthrough, read on.

Follow the following steps to get started on your Questkeeper journey:
* Create a folder with your GitHub username in Users folder.
* Create milestone.txt and enumerate your milestones for the week. Follow the convention for milestones as mentioned in the Framework.
*  Create your timesheet for the week. Follow the convention for timesheets as mentioned in the Framework.
*  You should only add those activities that you have mentioned in the milestones. This will help you in mapping your progress more efficiently and also keep you focused on what you set out to do (as opposed to jumping at every activity but rarely finishing anything). 

*  Remember the goal of the Questkeeper program is to help you ACHIEVE your goals. The results are as important as the efforts.
