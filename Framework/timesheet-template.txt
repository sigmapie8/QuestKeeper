timesheet is how you keep track of how many hours you are giving to your goals.
create a timesheet in the following manner :

MMDDYYYY
HH:MM (start time) - HH:MM (end time) - mins - <name of the task/subtask your worked on>
HH:MM (start time) - HH:MM (end time) - mins - <name of the task/subtask your worked on> (if work in more than one slot)

MMDDYYYY
HH:MM (start time) - HH:MM (end time) - mins - <name of the task/subtask your worked on>
HH:MM (start time) - HH:MM (end time) - mins - <name of the task/subtask your worked on> (if work in more than one slot)

timesheets are to be saved as - timesheet-MMDDYYYY-MMDDYYYY.txt under Users/<your name>/Timesheets/

as for commit messages, feel free to use them as you seem fit.
